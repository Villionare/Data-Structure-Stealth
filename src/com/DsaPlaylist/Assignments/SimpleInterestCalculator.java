//Simple Interest (SI) is the extra money you pay or earn when you borrow or lend money,
// calculated only on the original amount (principal) for the whole time period.

//Formula: (P * R * T)/100

//Where:
//P = Principal (the original amount of money)
//R = Rate of interest (per year, in %)
//T = Time (in years)
